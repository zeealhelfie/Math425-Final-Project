## Instructions to Run:
### Section 1
Run actorRanker.py in spyder or your favorite python compiler.

Results will be written into actorResults.txt (don't delete this file).
### Section 2
Open QRDecomposition.ipynb in jupyter notebook.

Or run classifier.py in spyder, where results will be printed in console.

Note: The video shows ~51% accuracy for the training data predictions. This is outdated, and the actual results when running the program should be ~95%.
### Section 3
Open classifications.ipynb in jupyter notebook.
